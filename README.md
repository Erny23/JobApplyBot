# JobApplyBot ü§ñ

**JobApplyBot** is an automation tool currently in development designed to simplify and optimize the process of searching and applying for job postings on online platforms like LinkedIn. Using **PuppeteerJS**, this bot automates the process of searching for job openings, filtering them based on custom parameters (such as location, job type, keywords, etc.), and applying to those that meet the established criteria. The goal is to save users time and effort, allowing them to focus on preparing for interviews and improving their skills. Currently, the bot is in the development phase, with future plans to support multiple job platforms.

## Key Features üöÄ

- **Google Chrome Connection**: Connects to the Google Chrome instance installed on the device, using the default path or a custom path specified in the `.env` file.
- **LinkedIn Authentication**: Logs into LinkedIn using the credentials provided in the `.env` file.
- **Automated Navigation**: Autonomously navigates through LinkedIn's interface to access job postings.
- **Job Search**: Collects key information from LinkedIn's recommended job postings, including:
  - Job **ID**.
  - Job **title**.
  - Job **location**.
  - Application **type** (easy, complex, etc.).
  - **Status** (viewed or not viewed).
- **Location Filtering**: Filters job postings based on location parameters (currently, this feature does not use the `.env` file).
