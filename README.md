# JobApplyBot ü§ñ

**JobApplyBot** is an automation tool currently in development designed to simplify and optimize the process of searching and applying for job postings on online platforms like LinkedIn. Using **PuppeteerJS**, this bot automates the process of searching for job openings, filtering them based on custom parameters (such as location, job type, keywords, etc.), and applying to those that meet the established criteria. The goal is to save users time and effort, allowing them to focus on preparing for interviews and improving their skills. Currently, the bot is in the development phase, with future plans to support multiple job platforms.

# Key Features üöÄ
